        My work consists on the development of the Java backend and Web frontend of Onmaps, a tool for analisys and visualization of geospatial data, usada mostly as marketing tool (Geomarketing).

      \item
        \textbf{Facebook}, Software Engineer - October/2012 to September/2014
        
        I've worked on the project responsible for managing all of Facebook's servers and other datacenter devices, and which acts as an intermediary between several automation tools, such as: Provisioning, application deployment, repairs, financial systems, data replication, monitoring, etc.
        
        This project is written in Java and communicates with other applications through Thrift APIs. I also contributed with several client applications, usually written in Python, PHP or C++.

    
      \item  
        \textbf{Veridis Tecnologia}, Software Engineer - September/2009 to October/2012

        Veridis develops solutions for biometric access control (Fingerprints in special). I was responsible for developing the library for capture and  matching Fingerprints (Based on NBIS) and the firmware for a embedded system that controls biometric doors and turnstiles.
        
        Most Development was done in C++, but all libraries have APIs and samples in Java and C\#.

      \item  
        \textbf{Griaule Biometrics}, Software Engineer - May/2006 to September/2009

        Griaule sells a software library for capture and matching of fingerprints. I was responsible with supporting several fingerprint scanners, Linux support, modularization and other improvements.
        
        Most development was done in C++, but there are bindings and examples for Java, Delphi, C\# and VB.

      \item
        \textbf{CPqD - Research and Development Center in Telecomunications}, Intern - December/2005 to February/2006

        As an intern, my job consisted in fixing known bugs, writing JUnit tests and add new features to existing reusable components.

        All components are written in Java and tipically use Hibernate, EJB e Struts.
